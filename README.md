# Telegram Messenger Dark Orange theme 
> A dark orange theme for [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org/).  There are two releases based on the single theme.  One has a workout background image, which is what inspired the theme colors in the first place.  The other doesn't contain the workout wallpaper.

## Install
1. Downlaod the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/recursivegeek/telegram-theme-darkorange/releases) and save to your local computer drive.
2. In *Telegram Desktop*, select the *hamburger* menu, select *Settings*, select *Chat Settings*, select *Choose from file*, select the file downloaded from the previous step.
3. Select *Keep Changes* to apply the theme.

## Development
Editing was done using the following:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Color Highlight extension](https://github.com/sergiirocks/vscode-ext-color-highlight)
- VS Color Picker (Windows Only)

The generated .tdesktop-theme file is a zip file that contains an image for tiled (tiled.jpg) or full background (background.jpg) and a color definition file (colors.tdesktop-theme).  Now, why they made the package file extension the same as the color definition file is beyond me, but it makes the confusion makes life a little more "interesting"! :-)

It is recommended to join the [Telegram Desktop Themes Channel](https://t.me/TelegramThemes) chat group.  There is a pinned message to help getting started.
