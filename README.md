# Telegram Messenger Dark Orange theme 
> A dark orange theme for [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org/).  There are three releases based on the single theme.  They are as follows:

1. Dark Orange theme with a dark orange background color
2. Dark Orange theme with workout wallpaper
3. Dark Orange theme with workout and Art of Strength Minnesota logo - this logo work was the inspiration for this theme colors

Here is a sample screenshots:

## Install
1. Download the latest theme version from [releases](https://github.com/recursivegeek/telegram-theme-darkorange/releases) and save to your local computer.
2. In **Telegram Desktop**, select the **hamburger** menu, select **Settings**, select **Chat Settings**, select **Choose from file**, select the file downloaded from the previous step.
3. Select **Keep Changes** to apply the theme.

## Development
Editing was done using the following:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Color Highlight extension](https://github.com/sergiirocks/vscode-ext-color-highlight)
- VS Color Picker (Windows Only) *Still looking for a version that universally works well on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms*

The generated *.tdesktop-theme* file is a zip file that contains an image for tiled (*tiled.jpg*) or full background (*background.jpg*) and a color definition file (*colors.tdesktop-theme*).  Now, why they made the package file extension the same as the color definition file is beyond me, but it makes the confusion makes life a little more "interesting"! :-)

## Submission
It is recommended to join the [Telegram Desktop Themes Channel](https://t.me/TelegramThemes) chat group.  There is a pinned message to help get started and this channel is used for theme submission.  The [Theme Submission Guidelines](https://telegra.ph/Content-Submission-Guidelines-06-04) provides information on potentially having the theme published into [Telegram Themes Channel](https://t.me/themes).
